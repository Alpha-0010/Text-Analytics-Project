Dean of the Graduate School Texas Tech University in its strategic plan, A Foundation
Texas Tech University for the Next Century, sets out the goal to become a
premier national research university. The strategic plan
of the Graduate School, Enhancing Graduate Education at
Texas Tech University: The Path to 2025, complements the
strategic plan of the university to help achieve this goal
by expanding the size, scope, and quality of its graduate
enterprise.
