UNIVERSITY OF SPLIT -
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
2026 - 2030
Preface
In the context of the future growth and development of our Department, and in line with the
guidelines of the Strategy aiming at enhancing quality and recognition, it is essential to clearly define
the directions and methods of future action. In this process, the unity of all Department stakeholders
has proven to be a key success factor. Our shared objective is to foster an environment that enables
everyone, supported by colleagues, to develop professionally and to contribute to the wider scientific
and professional community.
The Department represents a significant and forward-looking component of the University of Split
which, through its activities, continuously contributes to the development of the University and the
local community. The Department's Development Strategy serves not only as a roadmap for further
improvement, but also as a call for stronger collective engagement. Only through cooperation, mutual
trust, and coordinated efforts can we enhance our attractiveness to current and prospective students
and remain an appealing and competitive choice for study. To ensure the long-term success of our
Department and to continue being a flagship of professional study programmes at the University of
Split, it is essential to continuously invest in the expertise of all our members. Professional excellence
is what makes us recognizable, and our professional work must be acknowledged not only at the local
but also at the international level.
This Strategy was created thanks to the joint efforts and constructive contributions of numerous
colleagues. Every proposal, comment, and suggestion were included aiming to create a document that
will best serve the future development of the Department. It is precisely the willingness to collaborate,
to engage in open dialogue, and to embrace diverse perspectives that demonstrates that our
Department bases its progress on the strength of the collective.
I invite all members and stakeholders of our Department to embrace this Strategy as the foundation
of the Department's future activities and to work together in the coming period to ensure the
successful achievement of the set goals.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who, through their work, ideas, and
dedication, has contributed to the growth and development of our Department, as well as all those
whose efforts made it possible for this Strategy to come to life in its written form.
Our connectedness and cooperation form the foundation of sustainable development in the future
period.

In development of the Strategy of the Department, a participatory approach was applied, implying the
active involvement of all key stakeholders in the process of planning and defining the basic
determinants of the new strategic framework. Such an approach represents a move away from the
traditional "top-down" governance model and is based on broad stakeholder involvement. The
application of a participatory approach has brought numerous advantages, with the involvement of a
wide range of stakeholders aimed at developing the highest quality, the most comprehensive and the
most relevant strategic document possible. Also, one of the key intentions was to ensure a prominent
level of acceptance of the Strategy by all important participants, thus increasing its legitimacy, long-
term effectiveness and sustainability.
For the purpose of implementing this approach, and at the same time being its key organizational
elements, the following working teams were formed according to the strategic areas:

II. ANALYSIS OF OUTCOMES ACHIEVED BY THE UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF
PROFESSIONAL STUDIES STRATEGY, 2021-2025
PROFESSION, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
During the period of implementation of the 2021-2025 Strategy, the Department made noteworthy
progress in conducting the planned activities aimed at strengthening professional and scientific
excellence, developing entrepreneurship and cooperation with the business sector, and increasing
visibility and connectedness with the wider community. All planned activities were implemented in
accordance with the defined tasks, indicators and goals, and the results achieved contributed to the
attainment of the Department's strategic goals for the given period.
Scientific excellence defined by an increase in the number of teachers holding a doctoral degree has
been continuously promoted and cultivated by motivating teachers to advance academically,
participate in doctoral studies, and by creating conditions for their further academic affirmation.
During the period under review, six teachers at the Department obtained a doctoral degree and seven
teachers enrolled in doctoral studies.
Within the activities supporting the strategic areas of professional and scientific excellence, numerous
new projects and collaborations were established at the national and international levels. The
Department actively participated in the preparation and implementation of research and professional
projects in partnership with other institutions, including: The Project "Enhancement and
Implementation of Professional Practice at the University Department of Professional Studies",
reference number UP.03.1.1.04.0052 (2020-2023); The Project "Apricum Meteo - Development of a
Smart Meteorological Station for Infrastructure Management", reference number IP.1.1.03.0131
(2024-ongoing); The Project "Smartnet AI Solution for Integrated Smart City e‑Infrastructure
Management", reference number IP.1.1.03.0130 (2024-ongoing); Projects in Cooperation with the
Croatian Chamber of Economy (HGK): PlanStart 2021, PlanStart 2022, PlanStart 2023, PlanStart 2024,
PlanStart 2025; The Project "Boosting Widening Digital Innovation Hubs - BOWI", contract number
873155, funded under Horizon 2020 programme; and cooperation with Ivan Meštrović Secondary
School in Drniš, the Tourism and Hospitality School in Split, the Tourist Boards of the City of Split and
the Municipality of Okrug, and the Tax Administration - Split office.
The development of support structures for research and innovation was also pursued through
investments in human resources, modernisation of facilities, and procurement of equipment needed
for research activities. The Department continuously conducts activities aimed at strengthening
research infrastructure, equipping existing laboratories and opening new ones, thereby providing
better conditions for scientific and professional work. With the aim of increasing professional and
scientific cooperation and information exchange with the public, the Department implemented the
Open Science Policy of the University of Split and adopted it on 30 March 2023.
Excellence in human resources has been promoted and encouraged by enabling teaching and
non‑teaching staff to participate in domestic and international seminars, trainings, and conferences.
The number of participations regularly meets the planned target of at least one training per employee
per year, and in most cases even doubles it. During the period under review, staff attended 166
seminars and trainings and participated in 185 conferences, thus meeting the planned target of the
Strategy 2021-2025. This activity contributes to the continuous professional development of all
employees on a regular basis.
The organization and improvement of the international scientific‑professional conference CIET are
conducted regularly and are fully aligned with the Department's activity plan. The conference is held
every even calendar year (in 2022 it was held in Valencia, Spain, in cooperation with Florida
Universitaria; in 2024 it was held in Split), with the publication of conference proceedings and
continuous improvement of indexing and the quality of published papers, which has significantly
strengthened the Department's international recognition. The international visibility of the
Department has been further enhanced through systematic encouragement of staff and student
mobility. Participation in Erasmus+ programmes and other forms of international mobility has enabled
a large number of outgoing and incoming mobilities - during the period under review, 280 staff
mobilities and 94 student mobilities were recorded, which has contributed to strengthening the
Department's international cooperation and reputation. International Week, held every two years,
has a special role in enhancing international presence by bringing together international colleagues,
partner institutions and guest lecturers. During the period under review, the following outcomes were
completed:
- In 2022, International Week brought together 29 participants,
- In 2023, the number of participants increased to 55,
- In 2025, the event was organised in cooperation with the University of Split and the SEA‑EU
Alliance as a Blended Intensive Programme (BIP) and attracted 100 participants.
This growth and international diversity of participants confirm the importance of International Week
as a platform for exchanging good practices, developing new partnerships and further positioning the
Department within the European and global academic landscape.
In regard with societal development through creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, numerous
activities were implemented, resulting in concrete forms of cooperation with the business sector.
Cooperation with economic operators has been further enhanced by encouraging employees to
provide services through the Centre for Lifelong Learning and Adult Education, involving companies in
the Department's activities, and signing cooperation agreements through the Office for Cooperation
with Industry. During the period under review, 26 lifelong learning and adult education programmes
were implemented, including 7 open seminars and 12 in‑house trainings. There were 7 participants in
bridging programmes to meet the conditions for enrolment in professional graduate (master) studies.
Furthermore, 245 business cooperation agreements were active during the period under review,
which confirms the Department's orientation and focus on the business sector. In addition, activities
aimed at developing students' entrepreneurial skills were conducted through the Student
Entrepreneurship Incubator and related projects. Competitions, workshops, and webinars were
organised, providing students with practical experience and opportunities for networking.
Within the activities aimed at strengthening the Department's cohesion with the broader public,
round tables and workshops were held, through which the Department further reinforced its position
in society. The active participation of the Department's staff and students in public events,
humanitarian actions, and cultural and sports events contributed to increasing the Department's
visibility and enhancing public awareness of its professional and scientific achievements.
TEACHING AND STUDY PROGRAMMES
From 2021 to 2025, the higher education system in the Republic of Croatia, and thus the Department,
underwent significant changes driven by labour market dynamics, technological development and
growing societal expectations. This period was marked by the need to adapt study programmes,
redefine teaching practices and introduce digital tools into the educational process. In this context,
the Department was particularly committed to the strengthening of its identity as a professional
constituent of the University, focused on educating competent professionals whose knowledge and
skills correspond to the needs of employers in technical and social sciences fields.
Contemporary challenges in the environment prompted the Department to systematically improve
the teaching process and develop innovative educational models. Thus, in the observed five‑year
period, special emphasis was placed on improving the quality of teaching, increasing programme
flexibility, strengthening cooperation with the business sector and developing teaching methods that
enable active learning and the acquisition of practical competences.
In the past five years, the Department has conducted a series of activities aimed at modernising its
professional undergraduate and graduate study programmes. The need for regular revision of existing
study programmes became particularly evident, primarily in relation to learning outcomes, which
must reflect the competences essential for the effective integration of students into the labour
market. In the period from 2021 to 2025, the Department embraced the programme evolution as a
continuous process in which the structure of courses, teaching methods and the level of professional
orientation continually change to respond to new shifts in the economy and society.
Special emphasis was placed on intensifying cooperation with employers, which led to the increasing
involvement of the business sector in revising learning outcomes through organised round tables at
individual departments. In parallel, the need for the professional development of teaching staff grew,
especially in the field of professional training and the application of modern digital tools, which during
the observed period proved crucial for raising the quality of the teaching process.
During the period under review, the Department continuously worked on maintaining and improving
the quality of its study programmes, which constitute the fundamental purpose and identity of the
institution. For professional undergraduate and graduate studies to remain relevant, numerous
revisions of curricula were conducted, with particular attention given to updating courses and
increasing the involvement of economic stakeholders in defining and re‑examining learning outcomes.
To this end, and in accordance with the Regulations of Study Programme Evaluation of the University
of Split, the Department adopted the required amendments and supplements within the competence
of the Council for all its study programmes, as well as minor amendments and supplements to study
programmes approved by the Senate of the University of Split in 2024 and 2025.
In the last five years, the Department has intensified activities aimed at preparing interdisciplinary
programmes requiring cooperation of core departments and integration of areas that traditionally
operate separately. Consequently, this paves the way for educating professionals capable of solving
complex problems that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.
With the aim of strengthening project‑oriented learning, the Department systematically encourages
the development of student projects arising from professional courses, for example the PlanStart
Project in cooperation with the Croatian Chamber of Economy - Split County Chamber (HGK ŽK Split).
This approach has enabled the annual implementation of several projects in cooperation with the
business sector and has served as an initial "soft" model of dual learning. In this context, efforts were
also made to improve the system of analytics and reporting on teaching activities, which included the
implementation of a specialised software solution (the Sceduly information system).
The period from 2021 to 2025 was also distinguished by systematic encouragement of teachers to
engage in professional development, underpinned by one at least one recommendable participation
in annually held professional training programmes for every teacher. At the same time, considerable
efforts were put into increasing the attractiveness of study programmes through promotion,
strengthening visibility and increasing the share of students who select the Department as their
preferable faculty upon enrolment. In this regard, numerous activities were carried out to inform
secondary school graduates about the benefits of professional studies through the University of Split
Fair, organised visits within the Week of Professions in 2024 and 2025, and workshops for pupils
delivered by students, members of the Student Entrepreneurship Incubator.
It is particularly important to highlight an increase in the number of engaged alumni participating in
the teaching process as guest lecturers. Hence, a culture of connectedness and professional
networking activities are cultivated, which has proved essential for the development of students'
competences.
The role of the professional constituent of the University of Split implies a strong connection with the
business sector, which in the analysed period was one of the fundamental determinants of the
development of the teaching process. The Department anticipated and recognized the need for the
enhancement of the quality of professional studies through more intensive inclusion of practical
elements. Therefore, this insight resulted in a gradual rise in the share of practical teaching, enabling
students to apply theoretical knowledge in real working environments, which directly contributed to
raising the level of their professional competences.
Modern education requires the use of advanced software solutions and digital platforms. Therefore,
in the observed period, various digital teaching tools were integrated into the teaching process across
the Department's study programmes. Courses in social sciences and technical study programmes,
where applicable, were enriched with specialised software such as: Mathlab, Labview, KIS4ALL,
Synesis, Autodesk Moldflow Insight, Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Fluidsim Pneumatic,
Fluidsim Hydraulic, Granta EduPAck, Stat Ease Design Expert, EMCO WinNC Sinumerik 840D Turn/Mill,
Mach3 CNC, Siemens Logo‑soft, Python software, Arduino software, MD Solid, Ultimaker Cura,
Anaconda, Android Studio, Arduino IDE, Atmel AVR Studio 7.0, Bitcoin Core, Cisco Packet Tracer,
CodeBlocks, Docker, Eclipse, Electrum, Gimp, Git, HDTune, IntelliJ IDEA, MS Project, Node.JS, Oracle
VirtualBox, Process Explorer, SQL Server, Spider IDE, VMware Workstation, Visual Studio, Visual Studio
Code, Wireshark and others. This strengthened students' competitiveness in the labour market and
enhanced the transparency of their competences.
The system of professional and specialist practice was gradually reinforced through the development
of a dual mentoring model, whereby students received support both from teachers and from experts
at Department's partner institutions providing practice (teaching bases). This resulted in a higher
quality acquisition of learning outcomes and better preparation of students for the work environment.
An information system for student practice was also implemented, whereby digitalisation of the entire
process enabled transparent, fast and efficient implementation of the Professional Practice and
Specialist Practice courses, accompanied by respective implementation reports on an annual basis.
Special efforts were made to increase the number of final theses produced in cooperation with
companies and institutions, aiming at least at one tenth of annual final theses arising from it. This
fostered students' collaboration with the professional sector and the development of solutions to
concrete real‑world problems.
Finally, the role of teaching bases became crucial in the five‑year period. Their involvement in the
organization of practice, guest lectures and cooperation in teaching activities was intensified. At the
same time, teaching bases were continuously expanded, thereby creating a network of companies
and institutions, Department's partners, that systematically contribute to the development of
students' professional competences.
The challenges of the period from 2021 to 2025, especially those caused by global disruptions and the
accelerated digitalisation of society, had a strong impact on the educational process. The Department
recognised the need for the systematic development of distance learning as a component that
complements traditional teaching, increases its flexibility and enables inclusive student participation.
As a fundamental prerequisite, in the reviewed five-year period, numerous teacher training sessions
on the use of e‑learning tools were delivered. Efforts were made to ensure that each teacher
participated in at least two training events per year, one of which was organised by the Department.
This continuous investment in the development of teachers' digital skills enabled higher‑quality
implementation of modern teaching processes.
The period from 2021 to 2025 was one of accelerated transformation for the Department. Systematic
revision and modernisation of study programmes, strengthening their professional dimension and
intensifying cooperation with the business sector proved crucial for improving the quality of
education. Investments in digitalisation, internationalisation and the professional development of
teachers laid the foundations for a system that is adaptable, competitive and aligned with the needs
of modern society. During the reviewed period, the Department clearly confirmed its role in educating
professionals who are ready to face any labour market challenges and to contribute to the
development of the local, national and international community.
STUDENTS AND STUDENT STANDARDS
During the implementation period of the 2021-2025 Strategy, the Department made considerable
progress in achieving its strategic goals related to students and student standards. Through systematic
analysis of data from the Higher Education Information System (ISVU), including pass rates in
individual courses, completion rates and drop-out, a reliable system was established for monitoring
student progress and timely identification of areas requiring improvement. The training provided for
teaching staff contributed to the enhancement of teaching and assessment methods, greater
objectivity in grading, and the application of modern approaches in instruction. The activities
implemented helped reduce student drop-out and increase completion rates, thereby meeting key
criteria of this strategic goal in the period under review.
The Department ensured academic, career and personal counselling for students through cooperation
with the University of Split's Centre for Counselling and Career Development, as well as through the
activities of its Office for Cooperation with Industry, Technology Transfer Office and Vice-Head for
Student Affairs. Thus, the Department relies on existing university services and does not establish its
own centre but instead uses shared infrastructure and programmes. Through training sessions and
events such as the Week of Professions, the University of Split Fair and Open Days, students were
introduced to the possibilities offered by teaching bases and were able to connect with employers.
Continuous support was provided to students in developing professional competences, which
contributes to their better preparedness for the labour market and finally to the attainment of the
strategic goal in the observed period.
In cooperation with the Student Centre of the University of Split, a student restaurant was opened
within the premises of the Department, thus ensuring high-quality and affordable meals for students
and improving their everyday study conditions. Student satisfaction monitoring indicated its positive
effect on the quality of the student experience. As an integral part of the University, the Department
continued to cooperate with the Student Centre and the University of Split in securing appropriate
accommodation capacities for its students, in line with the proportional share of its students in the
University's total student population. This cooperation resulted in the improvement of key elements
of student standards and provision of stable conditions for high-quality study and student life
throughout the entire Strategy implementation period.
Significant progress was made in improving study conditions for students from vulnerable and
underrepresented groups. Accessibility of facilities was enhanced by installing a lift in the old building
and a movable platform in the new one, thereby ensuring unimpeded movement for students with
disabilities. Socially disadvantaged students were provided with the possibility to pay tuition fees in
instalments, while part-time students were allowed to enrol in at least 30 ECTS credits to facilitate
their study progress. These measures significantly improved study conditions and ensured greater
access to education for all students.
In addition, support was provided to students through the University's Psychological Counselling
Centre, legal and medical advisory services, and cooperation with the Teaching Institute of Public
Health of Split-Dalmatia County, thereby improving mental and physical health programmes. Students
were regularly involved in sports activities through an organised schedule of physical and health
education classes and access to sports facilities (halls, swimming pools, etc.), and they also
participated in the University sports competitions, STEM Games and eGames. The Department
encouraged student involvement in professional and research projects, both within the Department
and in cooperation with the business sector and international partners. A peer-to-peer support
initiative was launched, through which senior students help junior ones with learning and navigating
their study obligations. Students also actively participated in humanitarian, social and cultural
activities, which further enriched the quality of student life and the academic community. These
activities significantly contributed to the holistic development of students and to raising the standard
of studying at the Department.
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
The period from 2021 to 2025 brought strong impetus to the boosting of the international dimension
of higher education. Globalisation processes, the rapid advancement of technology and the growing
mobility of knowledge shaped a new context in which the Department had to position itself
strategically. As part of a university community striving to internationalise its academic processes and
to open up to the European Higher Education Area, the Department recognised the necessity of a
systematic build-up of international cooperation, an increase in mobility and the development of an
open, competitive system capable of participating on an equal footing in contemporary international
educational flows.
International visibility and networking became key prerequisites for enhancing the quality of study
programmes, for the exchange of good practices, and for providing an institutional framework that
attracts international partners, lecturers and students. To this end, a clear strategic direction towards
increased international networking was selected, gradually becoming one of the fundamental
development areas of the Department during the period from 2021 to 2025.
In the analysed period, the Department embarked on a more intensive process of international
opening, recognising the potential of international cooperation as a key mechanism for ensuring the
quality of education and recognition at the European level. The increased emphasis on mobility was a
response to the rapid changes in global higher education and at the same time a necessity for
strengthening the competences of students who are preparing for a labour market in which
international experience is becoming the norm rather than the exception.
Over the five years, enhanced efforts were made to build a base of international partners, primarily
through programmes such as Erasmus+, but also through other international and bilateral ties. At the
same time, it became clear that the competitiveness of the Department could be increased through a
clear orientation towards international standards, which implied designing course catalogues for the
Erasmus+ programmes and joint study programmes and promoting of "internationalisation at home"
models.
The mobility of students, teaching and non‑teaching staff was one of the key development areas.
Although mobility outcomes varied from year to year, the Department's strategic goal was to achieve
stable growth in outgoing and incoming mobility, using various sources of funding and fostering
stronger links with European higher education institutions. In this context, initiatives such
International Week or the idea of joint study programmes became an important part of the strategic
direction. They represent a response to the needs of a higher education area increasingly relying on
internationalisation as a mechanism of quality, visibility and sustainable development.
In the period from 2021 to 2025, the Department recognised that international networking makes for
the springboard for all further internationalisation processes. Strengthening existing partnerships and
establishing new Erasmus+ partnership agreements became an important strategic priority. According
to the observed trend, emphasis was placed on planned and targeted cooperation with foreign
institutions, with the aim of increasing the overall number of partnership agreements and improving
their content quality. During the period under review, the focus was on designing a systematic
approach to networking that includes teaching and non‑teaching staff, heads of departments and the
Department's management. This comprehensive approach enabled the expansion of international
activities to all departments and the provision of conditions for sustainable mobility growth.
Given the growing need for the internationalisation of studies, the Department moved towards
designing educational contents that can become highly competitive at the European level. A key
element of this was the provision of courses and teaching materials in English, and thereby the
prerequisites for attracting foreign students and encouraging mobility within the Erasmus+
programme.
One of the more important initiatives was the design of a course catalogue for the Erasmus+
programme, with as many teachers as possible offering at least one course. In this way, a
comprehensive catalogue was gradually designed, potentially attractive to students from partner
institutions and facilitating in the process of international exchange. In the period from 2021 to 2025,
this activity represents a crucial step towards the standardisation and transparency of the study offer.
Student and staff mobility was recognised as a fundamental indicator of international activity, so
efforts were made to increase outgoing and incoming mobility through various funding programmes.
The goal was to ensure the growth of mobility, which was achieved in some years, while in others it
was hampered by global circumstances; nevertheless, mobility remained a stable strategic priority of
the institution.
Strategic considerations revolved around the development of the International Week programme to
a great extent. This programme, which includes invited lectures, workshops, teaching projects and
other forms of academic cooperation, became a platform for strengthening the Department's
international visibility and for networking with institutions from Europe and beyond. From 2021 to
2025 initiatives were also launched to develop joint study programmes, especially with universities
from economically developed countries. These activities represent an important strategic step
towards designing an educational offer that goes beyond national boundaries.
The period from 2021 to 2025 proved to be crucial for the development of the Department's
international dimension. The systematic increase of international networking, the building of
partnership networks, the intensification of mobility and the development of an educational offer in
English laid the foundations for further strengthening of the Department's position within the
European Higher Education Area. The results of surveys among foreign students indicate a prominent
level of teaching quality, which provides an important basis for enhancing the Department's
international visibility and reputation. Although many processes are still in progress, the direction and
intensity of the activities undertaken clearly show that the Department's orientation towards a
modern, open and internationally competitive model of higher education.
ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES
The strategic area Organization and Resources represented one of the foundations of the
Department's development during the 2021-2025 period. In this time, systematic efforts were made
to strengthen organizational capacities, affirm the Department's identity, modernise infrastructure
and technological equipment, and improve management and work processes. The goals defined in the
Strategy were aimed at the Department's long‑term sustainability, the creation of optimal conditions
for teaching and professional activities, and the enhancement of overall institutional efficiency. The
following Presentation of achievements reflects a significant development step and the creation of
preconditions for the next strategic cycle.
In regard with strengthening the Department's identity, progress was made in improving
communication with external stakeholders. The website underwent visual and functional renewal,
modern communication channels were established, and existing official social media profiles were
upgraded and new ones created (for example, a WhatsApp channel and an Instagram profile), which
enabled more intensive interaction with prospective students, the business sector and the wider
public. The Regulations of Online Content and Online Posting of the University Department of
Professional Studies were adopted, defining procedures and mechanisms for publishing information
to the public electronically. The Department's visibility increased through a higher number of posts,
expert contributions and public appearances. The visual identity of the Department was modernised,
and the departments were given new graphic standards, which serve as a basis for further
development of visual identities in the next strategic period. In the current period, a clearer, more
contemporary and more professional image has been created, contributing to better positioning of
professional studies.
Within the infrastructure domain, which represents one of the fundamental strategic pillars of the
Department's activities, a great development leap was made. During the period under review, a
detailed analysis of the existing technical and project documentation was conducted, enabling better
planning of future investments and their alignment with available funding sources, particularly
European Union funds. In this context, the Department systematically prepared project bases and
documentation to ensure timely inclusion in national and European calls for infrastructural project
funding. In addition, a special student bus line was introduced as the first public line directly
connecting Kopilica with the wider urban area, thereby significantly improving students' access to the
Department.
A particularly important step forward in terms of student standards was the opening of the
long‑awaited student restaurant S.O.S. in the building at Kopilica 5. This represents one of the most
important improvements in student standards, as students were, for the first time, provided with
high‑quality and reasonably priced meals within the Department itself.
To improve spatial capacities and create preconditions for long‑term investments, project
documentation was prepared for the reconstruction of the façade of the Kopilica 5 building. Based on
this documentation, the Department applied to the Public Call for the Energy Renovation of Public
Buildings and obtained non‑refundable funds in the amount of EUR 498,101.77. The support obtained
confirms the project's quality and represents an important opportunity for the comprehensive
renovation of one of the Department's key buildings.
At the end of 2025, construction works began on the energy renovation of the Kopilica 5 building and
are expected to be completed during the new strategic period (2026), after which the building will
reach a significantly higher level of energy efficiency. Electricity consumption is expected to decrease
by approximately 60%, which will contribute to more rational resource management and the
reduction of operating costs. In addition to the energy effects, the modernised building will provide
better and safer conditions for work and study and, with its renewed appearance, contribute to the
overall revitalisation of the Kopilica area. In the same period, all Department buildings were equipped
with new lifts and platforms for people with mobility difficulties, thereby ensuring full accessibility and
the removal of architectural barriers.
Concerning spatial resource management, special emphasis was placed on solving the issue of the
parking area between the north and south buildings. After a period of use based on a lease, the
Department purchased 91% of the land in question, thus ensuring long‑term and stable management
of this important infrastructural capacity. By improving access and installing an entrance control
system, the standard of parking use was raised and more efficient space management for students
and staff was ensured. This move ensured prerequisites for the permanent and systematic resolution
of parking capacity issues in the future.
Continuous investments in equipment and technical resources enabled a significant upgrade of
laboratory and computer infrastructure. Particular attention was given to the needs of technical study
programmes, with the acquisition of modern computer equipment, specialised instruments and
laboratory systems that enhance the quality of teaching and generate better conditions for
professional and project‑based activities. This represents a crucial step forward compared to the
previous situation and ensures a higher level of the Department's technological equipment.
Strengthening management and administrative capacities was one of the key accomplishments in this
strategic period, during which the Department significantly improved digital processes and
modernised working methods. In recent years, new digital systems have been introduced to support
administrative and teaching activities, such as Sceduly for organising and recording teaching processes
and the Konto programme for financial and accounting operations. In addition, modern solutions for
data exchange and storage via OneDrive have been implemented, making communication and
information flow safer, faster and more efficient.
It is particularly worth emphasising that the Department was the first constituent of the University of
Split to introduce a chatbot as a support tool for students, thereby ensuring constant availability of
basic information and improving user support. This step marked the beginning of the application of
artificial intelligence in the Department's Day‑to‑day operations, paving the way for further digital
transformation. At the same time, an e‑index (electronic grade book) was introduced, terminating the
traditional paper index and enabling students to monitor their requirements more easily, gain faster
insight into grades and communicate more efficiently with teachers. Taken together, all these
measures represent an important organizational step towards a modern and digitally based model of
higher education.
As part of the development of organizational resources, quality management was also improved.
Through regular meetings of the Committee for Quality Assurance, systematic internal audits and
digitalisation of evaluation procedures, the transparency and efficiency of processes were increased.
Changes in organizational resources also included strengthening internal institutional relations,
improving communication between organizational units and increasing the alignment of
administrative and teaching processes. Emphasis was placed on flexibility in management,
accommodating the needs of a dynamic academic environment and compliance with national and
European guidelines in the field of higher education.
Young and motivated staff and continuous investment in their professional and teaching development
are a great asset to the Department. It is important to emphasise that the quality and efficiency of the
Department's activities and operations are not to be attributed solely to teaching staff, but also to
support and administrative services, which make a significant contribution to the functioning and
development of the institution. The Department also relies on external associates whose expert
knowledge and practical experience enrich the teaching and research process and strengthen links
with the business sector and the wider community.
In conclusion, the implementation of the strategic area Organization and Resources at the Department
in the period 2021-2025 brought extensive structural changes, development stability and the
strengthening of all aspects of institutional activity. The Department has significantly improved its
infrastructure, modernised work and management processes, reinforced its identity and visibility, and
created conditions for more rational, efficient and modern operations. These results form a solid
foundation for the next strategic cycle, in which the focus will be on completing ongoing infrastructural
projects, further digitalisation, strengthening cooperation with the business sector and enhancing
academic excellence.
THE UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES IN ITS ENVIRONMENT
The Department maintains intensive and successful interaction with its surroundings and fully affirms
its role as a key driver of development. Through its activities, it effectively brings together diverse
stakeholders around addressing key contemporary challenges. By making all its resources available to
representatives of civil society, businesses, and local and regional self-government units, and by
actively cooperating with them, the Department generates a strong multiplier effect in overcoming
existing challenges and fostering innovative solutions for the future. Cooperation with stakeholders
has resulted in long-term partnerships that enable the development of new initiatives and projects.
The Department has established systematic communication channels that facilitate the exchange of
knowledge and experience between the academic community and the public. Joint activity
programmes have been implemented that support local community development and contribute to
strengthening social and economic cohesion. Through its involvement in regional and international

reflected in the continuous provision of new opportunities for growth, innovation and sustainable
development.
Through various activities, the Department has participated five times over the last five years in the
annually held events "Science Festival" and "Researchers' Night".
Thematic round tables, held regularly at all departments, have provided a forum for discussion of
current topics relevant to the professions nurtured at the Department.
An analytical tool for collecting feedback from the real sector in the form of a questionnaire has been
created. The questionnaire was distributed to participants of the held round tables (evidence of the
analysis conducted is attached), and interested contacts were listed in a database. The questionnaire
was also published on the website under Lifelong Learning, Expression of Interest:

The Department continuously promotes social responsibility through concrete activities directed
towards the local community. As part of its initiatives, the Department has donated computer
equipment to primary and secondary schools as well as the humanitarian organization Caritas, thereby
contributing to the enhancement of digital literacy and the creation of better conditions for the
education of young people and those in need. Special emphasis is also placed on fostering cooperation
and the active involvement of students in sports and cultural activities in their environment. The
Department nurtures partnership relations with sports clubs, such as basketball club KK Split and
football club HNK Hajduk, providing students with opportunities for volunteering, participation in
projects and build-up of additional competences through extra‑curricular activities. Furthermore,
students and members of the Department's Alumni Association regularly participate in humanitarian
activities, including collecting donations for socially vulnerable groups, organising voluntary blood
donations, and supporting local associations and initiatives that contribute to community well‑being.
Through such activities, solidarity, empathy and active citizenship are promoted. Hence, the
Department reaffirms its commitment to community development, strengthening links with sports
and cultural institutions, and encouraging socially beneficial engagement among its students.

Further in the text, strategic goals are defined within identified strategic areas, followed by the
definition of tasks related to the realization of strategic goals. Each task is accompanied by an
indicator, description of the indicator, implementation and responsible persons.
TEACHING PROCESS AND STUDENTS
In the period from 2026 to 2030, the Department will direct its development towards enhancing the
quality, relevance and sustainability of professional higher education, building on experience gained
in previous years and responding to the demands of the contemporary socio-economic environment.
The Department's key goal is to strengthen its position as an institution that provides education
aligned with labour market needs, while simultaneously maintaining high academic, professional, and
ethical standards. In this context, particular emphasis is placed on study programmes that reflect
labour market dynamics and the standards of the European Higher Education Area, while promoting
an interdisciplinary approach and strengthening the practical component of studies.
The development of study programmes assumes that modern students must be prepared to work in
an environment characterised by continuous change, particularly under the influence of digital
technologies and artificial intelligence. Accordingly, the integration of digital tools across all segments
of teaching is planned, fostering interactive and applied learning, rapid adaptation to technological
innovation and the development of competencies that enable independent problem-solving in
complex situations. At the same time, the pedagogical and methodological competencies of teaching
staff will be further developed to modernise the teaching process and ensure its alignment with the
expectations of students and employers. Through the continuous development of digital,
communication and project-based skills among teaching staff, an environment will be created in which
innovation, openness and effective communication form the foundation of everyday academic
practice.
Special emphasis is placed on the digital transformation of the Department. In the forthcoming period,
the development of advanced digital infrastructure is planned to support an elevated level of
personalised learning, including digital repositories, analytical systems for monitoring student
progress and tools for automated assessment. These developments will enable more efficient
planning of the teaching process and more precise adaptation of teaching content to individual
student needs. Digital tools will also be applied within the broader administrative and organizational
context to enhance transparency, improve access to information and raise the overall quality of the
student experience.
Lifelong learning remains one of the strategic areas that the Department intends to develop
intensively. The focus will be placed on flexible and modular forms of learning tailored to diverse
groups of participants, including employed individuals, employers and institutions from both the
public and private sectors. Such programmes will enable rapid responses to change in industry and
the labour market, while strengthening the Department's position as a relevant partner in regional
development and economic innovation.
The development of student standards and support systems represents an essential element of the
Department's strategic orientation. The Department will continue to foster an inclusive and
supportive environment in which every student is provided with access to appropriate academic,
counselling and psychological support. Particular attention will be devoted to mental health,
motivation, and the development of socio-emotional competencies, alongside the strengthening of
activities that promote solidarity, community engagement and overall well-being. Digital support
systems, such as e-counselling services and AI-based assistants, will complement existing services and
further improve their accessibility.
Cooperation with the business sector and other institutions remains a key foundation for the
successful implementation of professional study programmes. The Department will develop new
models of cooperation that enable students to engage directly with the real sector, commence high-
quality professional practice and participate in projects that simulate real business situations. This
approach strengthens students' readiness for the labour market and supports the development of
competencies most valued by employers. Digital e-portfolios, career guidance systems and the
integration of artificial intelligence into career planning processes will further enhance the quality of
the transition from education to professional life.
The development of student initiatives and activities represents a critical component of creating a
dynamic and inclusive academic environment. By supporting student associations, creative projects,
competitions and innovation workshops, the Department will encourage the development of
entrepreneurial and research-oriented mindsets and strengthen competencies developed beyond the
formal curriculum. Such an environment contributes to the creation of an academic community that
connects education, professional practice and society, while enhancing the Department's visibility and
reputation.
Through all these processes, the Department will continue to develop professional standards, digital
capacities and international recognition during the observed period, thereby creating stable
foundations for further growth and development. At the centre of all activities remains the student,
his or her well-being and readiness for successful integration into a dynamic, digital and globalised
working environment. Through this approach, the Department confirms its role as a modern,
responsible and strategically oriented institution that educates professionals ready to meet the
challenges of the future.

PROFESSION, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
This strategic area focuses primarily on the development and strengthening of professional activity as
the key strength of the Department. This expert activity is not only at the core of all the actions
undertaken by the Department, but it also represents the main instrument for connecting higher
education with the needs of the economy and society.
Through the systematic improvement of the quality and scope of professional activities, the
Department will ensure the transfer of applicable knowledge into practice, encourage the
development of professional competencies and contribute to the economic growth. Professional
projects, advisory services and cooperation with economic operators represent both the backbone of
the development of professional excellence and a direct link between the University and the labour
market.
Within the general objective "Raise the level of professional, scientific and innovation activity", the
Department will primarily focus on strengthening professional activity but will also systematically
encourage scientific productivity and innovation potential.
Scientific activity will focus predominantly on the research into issues arising from professional
activities and responding to the specific needs of the economy. The department will develop the
innovation framework through strengthening cooperation with the economy, thus increasing the
number of innovation and transferring knowledge and technology to the real sector. Entrepreneurship
and the development of professional and entrepreneurial incubators, that support students, teachers
and associates in creating innovative solutions, will be encouraged.
An important segment of its activity is the popularization of professional and scientific work, with the
aim of increasing the visibility of the Department in the community. Activities aimed at young people
and the wider community will seek to stimulate interest in vocational and applied professions and
strengthen the perception of vocational education as a driver of innovation and economic progress.
Through the integration of professional excellence, scientific productivity and innovation activities,
the Department will continue to strengthen its role as the leading teaching unit of the University of
Split that continuously contributes to the development of regional competitiveness, economic growth
and social sustainability.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT INTO ITS
ENVIRONMENT
This strategic area focuses on strengthening international cooperation, integration and global
recognition of the Department. The Department is positioned as an open, internationally oriented and
socially engaged unit of the University of Split, focusing on both the improvement of partnerships and
mobility and the contribution to the community. Through its teaching, professional and project
activities, the Department continuously strengthens links with academic institutions, industry and the
community.
Within the framework of internationalization, the Department will systematically improve
cooperation with foreign institutions through the expansion of international networks, participation
in European mobility initiatives and programmes, and the organization of international scientific and
professional events. The activities will be aimed at both increasing international visibility and creating
stable and long-term partnerships that contribute to the development of educational, research and
professional capacities. Special emphasis will be placed on the development of courses and study
programmes in English and on the development of joint graduate study programmes in cooperation
with partner institutions, with the aim of attracting foreign students and teachers and creating a
framework for excellence in mobility.
Investing in the development of linguistic, digital and professional skills of students, teachers and
administrative staff will be the key to their successful inclusion in the international academic
environment. In addition, the Department will develop institutional and financial mechanisms to
support mobility, which seeks to increase the availability and number of participants in international
exchanges. The use of modern digital tools and the development of virtual and hybrid mobility will be
encouraged, which will enable additional models of international cooperation and access to global
educational resources.
In the area of social responsibility and cooperation with the community, the Department will intensify
partnerships with industry, the public sector and civil society. The Department will actively participate
in socially beneficial, educational and development projects. It will also focus on upgrading
cooperation through quality internship programmes, teaching and projects of regional importance
thus contributing to the digital, technological and entrepreneurial transformation of the community.
Cooperation with incubators, entrepreneurial centres and business entities, along with the
development of AI innovation and the encouragement of student entrepreneurship, will further
strengthen the transfer of knowledge and technologies between the academic and economic sectors.
The Department will work on strengthening its role as a socially responsible institution by increasing
visibility in the community, organizing public events, conferences, seminars and professional training
courses. Special attention will be paid to projects that promote inclusiveness, sustainable
development, ethics and solidarity, as well as the involvement of students in initiatives of social
importance. By opening its doors to the public and local organizations, the Department will actively
contribute to the creation of a climate of cooperation and active citizenship.
Through successful strategy implementation, the Department will consolidate its position as an
internationally connected, innovative and socially responsible institution that actively contributes to
the quality of higher education, the development of the economy and the well-being of the
community at the local, national and European level.

ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT
The management of the Department is oriented towards the development of an efficient, transparent
and modern system that supports excellence in the educational, professional and development
activities of the Department. As the only constituent unit of the University of Split fully dedicated to
professional higher education programmes, the Department plays a vital role in connecting higher
education with the needs of the economy and the local community, with the aim of educating
professionals who are ready for immediate integration into the labour market.
In the upcoming strategic period, the emphasis will be placed on further improvement of the
organizational structure and management processes, alongside the development of systems that
enable greater efficiency, digital connectivity and systematic monitoring of performance outcomes.
Key factors for successful operation will include strengthening internal capacities, professional
development of staff, and improved integration between teaching and administrative personnel.
Special attention will be devoted to modernisation of infrastructure and equipment, to ensure modern
spatial and technical conditions for teaching and the implementation of professional practice. In this
context, the Department will invest intensively in digital transformation, the development of smart
classrooms, digital laboratories and e-learning systems. At the same time, the application of artificial
intelligence in both the educational process and management will be encouraged through the analysis
of student data, the development of digital teaching assistants and the automation of administrative
processes. Such an approach will enable the creation of an agile and data-driven institution ready for
the challenges of modern higher education.
The development and empowerment of human resources remain among the main priorities.
Investment will be made in education and professional development of academic and non-academic
staff, the promotion of staff mobility, and the encouragement of lifelong learning. Cooperation with
industry will be further enhanced through the involvement of professionals from practice and alumni
in teaching and mentoring activities.
Alumni, who over time gain valuable experience in professional environments, represent a significant
resource in the development of the Department. Their networking and active participation in the work
of the Department will be encouraged through Alumni associations, especially in the areas of
mentoring, professional cooperation and the promotion of study programmes.
The financial development of the Department will be based on responsible resource management,
diversification of funding sources and strengthening of project-based activities. National and
European funds will be used for investment in infrastructure, digitalisation, professional and research
projects, and the enhancement of staff competencies.
In the area of organizational and resource development, the Department will place particular
emphasis on business sustainability and resilience to change. Rational energy use, regular
maintenance of facilities and equipment, and the introduction of principles of green transition and
social responsibility will become integral components of everyday operations.
The Department will continue to foster a culture of efficiency, openness and accountability, with the
aim of becoming a recognised centre of professional higher education - practice-oriented, innovative
and intricately connected with industry, for the benefit of students and the development of the
community.

IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING
Strategy is a key instrument for ensuring the successful realization of the established strategic goals
and measures, enabling timely recognition of achievements and potential challenges. Regular
monitoring and reporting ensure transparency, accountability and compliance with the established
goals, and provides the basis for timely adjustments and improvements.
The Strategy is implemented primarily through annual action plans, which link the Department's
strategic framework with specific activities, responsibilities, and deadlines. Action plans define success
indicators and the extent to which they are implementable, considering institutional and financial
framework and the availability of resources.
After detailed analysis, the responsible persons of activities relevant for the achievement of strategic
goals are obliged to define target values of the outcome indicators of their activities on an annual
basis, which forms the basis for the adoption of the annual action plan. Annual action plans and their
implementation play a key role in the implementation of the Strategy, as they enable systematic
monitoring, coordination and evaluation of the Department activities and timely recognition of the
need for corrective measures.
Systematic monitoring of the Strategy through annual action plans and monitoring of their
implementation, enables optimization of resources, improvement of all related activities, and
strengthens the Department's ability to continuously contribute to the achievement of strategic goals
and long-term sustainable development.

Acknowledgement / Conclusion
Lastly, we consider it important to highlight the significance of the joint and participatory approach
that characterized the process of preparation of the Department's Development Strategy until 2030.
In this respect, we express our sincere gratitude to all employees, members of the Strategy
Development Committee, members of working groups and other stakeholders who actively
participated in this complex and responsible process with their knowledge, experience, and dedicated
work.
Your contribution in all stages of strategic planning, from the situation analysis and SWOT analysis to
the definition of strategic goals, measures and activities, was crucial for the development of a high-
quality, comprehensive, and sustainable strategic document. The participatory approach to
developing the Strategy represents a solid foundation for its successful implementation and confirms
the Department's commitment to cooperation, transparency, and shared responsibility for future
development.
Once again, we thank everyone for their effort and professionalism, and we hope that the results of
this joint work will have a long-term and positive impact on the development of our Department and
the University of Split as a whole.
The Department's Management Board
