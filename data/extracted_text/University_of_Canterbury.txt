Tangata Tū, Tangata Ora
Our strategic vision for 2020 to 2030 sets the direction for UC to further increase our impact for good in the coming years, regionally and globally. Learn more about our strategy and plans.
The University of Canterbury has been making a difference in people’s lives and society for 150 years.
UC's Strategic Vision 2020-2030
Our Vision & Mission
Since the inaugural address at the founding of the Canterbury Collegiate Union in 1872, this university has stood for accessible higher education, service to community, and the encouragement of talent without barriers of distance, wealth, class, gender or ethnicity.
This Strategy is a clear statement that the University continues to stand for these principles and explicitly aims to produce graduates who are engaged with their communities, empowered to act for good and determined to make a difference in the world.
An overarching driver of this Strategy is an institutional commitment to engagement. A university that commits itself to engagement undertakes to deploy its expertise and knowledge to advance civic purpose and to foster public good.
UC will continue to support staff who are engaged, empowered and making a difference, with the goal of increasing purposeful academic efforts to make a difference regionally and in the world. UC supports academic staff taking the role of critic and conscience of society and an active role in shaping Aotearoa New Zealand society.
The University affirms its identity as a medium-sized, research-intensive, comprehensive university. It strives to deliver excellent, research-informed education, and creative and innovative research.
Henry John Tancred was the first Chancellor of the University of New Zealand (as University of Canterbury was first known). In his inaugural address launching the Canterbury Collegiate Union he propounded his view that the new college should be entirely inclusive:
“It is of the greatest importance to the well-being of the whole that this influence should be felt in every part and among all classes, that high as well as low, rich as well as poor, should have every opportunity afforded to them of cultivating and developing the higher faculties in such a manner as will fit them for occupying worthily the highest position in the State.”
– Henry John Tancred (1872)

The very nature of higher education, its delivery, relevance and impact as well as the role of universities in society is expected to change dramatically. Just as globalisation and technology have transformed all sectors of the economy in the past 25 years, in the decades to come, universities face significant transformation.
With massive diversification in the range of providers, methods and technologies delivering tertiary education worldwide, the assumptions underlying the traditional relationship between universities, students, and local and national economies are increasingly under great pressure. These pressures come from the changing world of learning, work and society, with the factors that affect our work broadly characterised in six key trends: the nature of knowledge, new ways of learning, geopolitics, social cohesion, sustainability, and the nature of work.
This strategy is designed to support UC’s responses to each of these trends. In doing so it has identified five ways to address these pressures effectively: refocusing UC on our academic mission; addressing issues using a communitarian approach; addressing problems head on with an inter-disciplinary focus; actively working on culture and behaviour to act as one university; and taking a decisive stand on sustainability.
