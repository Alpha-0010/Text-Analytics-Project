1. INTRODUCTION
Anadolu University, a long-time member of European University Association (EUA),
completed its first institutional evaluation process, made the required changes considering the
feedback obtained from the evaluation and now considers applying a new external evaluation
process as an integral part of its quality improvement efforts. As one of the largest universities in
the world with a pioneering role in many fields, Anadolu University has been focusing on
continuous improvement in order to sustain its accomplishments and take further steps towards
its goals.
Bologna Process combined with the increasing importance of the internalization and
Turkey's effort to become a full member of the European Union made a major impact on Turkish
higher education institutions to review their systems. Anadolu University strongly believes that
EUA evaluation process and its outcomes will make a great contribution to enhance its
continuous improvement efforts.

1.2. Involvement of Stakeholders
During the preparation of the self-evaluation report, there has been cooperation with the
representatives of the sector, the students and their representatives, the deans of the faculties,
the heads of the departments, the directors of the institutions and the units, and the academic
members.
1.3. The Sharing Process of the Self-Evaluation Report
The self-evaluation report has been shared with the whole academic and administrative
personnel and the students. Moreover, it has been available on the Open Education Faculty's
webpage for the students having a distant education. The required changes have been made
taking the feedback into consideration.
1.4. The Experience of Institutional Self-Evaluation Process
The following factors influenced the preparation of the Self-Evaluation Report process
positively;
 The same team members prepared the Universtiy's Strategic Plan for the years 2014-
2018 a short time ago (Appendix 1).
 Some of the team members having taken charge in the previous EUA evaluation
participated in the evaluation process.
 The self-evaluation report team included the members from different academic and
administrative units representing the University.
 The team got together every week to prepare the self-evaluation report.
 Some preliminary work was done by a sub-group in order to speed the preparation
process.
 The team included students from different units and educational levels.
 The report was prepared colloboratively; it was shared with different stakeholders, and
their opinions were taken into consideration in the final version.
On the other hand,
 The heavy workload of the team members was the factor influencing the preparation
process of the self-evaluation report negatively.
2. INSTUTIONAL CONTEXT
2.1. The History of Anadolu University
The foundation of Anadolu University goes back to 1958, a time when Eskişehir Academy
of Economic and Commercial Sciences was established. In 1982, the Academy was replaced by
Anadolu University, which has gained a well-deserved place as a modern, dynamic and
innovative institution among the largest universities not only in Turkey but also in the world.
Some of the faculties and schools as well as the majority of administrative units and social
facilities are located at Yunusemre Campus, which is at the center of Eskişehir, renowned as a
center of science and culture and a city of youth. İki Eylül Campus, which houses the Faculty of
Sports Sciences, the Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Faculty of Engineering, and the
School of Foreign Languages, is only five kilometers to the city center. Anadolu Airport is
situated on this campus as well. Porsuk and Transportation Vocational Schools offer education
in the city center.
Anadolu University is an institution, promoting universal higher education values and
blazing trails in the Turkish higher education with its 17 faculties (3 of which offer open
education), 4 vocational schools, 3 schools, 9 graduate schools, 30 research centers, and 21
research, development and application units. Anadolu University stands out with the innovative
initiatives in the distance education system. Today the total number of students in three faculties
offering open education is over one million. This system has been taken as a model by many
universities.
2.2. The Legal Status of Anadolu University
In Turkey, the formal educational system is composed of 4 years of primary school, 4 years
of secondary school, 4 years of high school and higher education (Appendix 2). The higher
education is defined as all post-secondary programs of at least two years duration. Ministry of
National Education (MoNE) and the Council of Higher Education (CoHE) are two bodies in
charge of education in Turkey. CoHE, as the central regulatory body, is responsible for higher
education including graduate studies whereas MoNE is in charge of all lower level education.
There are 184 higher education institutions 72 of which are foundation universities in
Turkey. Anadolu University is a state university.
2.3. National and Regional Labor Market
The Key Features of Labor Market in Turkey: In Turkey, the most important problem of
the labor market with its great potential due to its young population is low labor force
participation rate. There has been differing views about the reasons of high unemployment and
low labor force participation rate. Especially structural issues such as the rural depopulation
process continuing increasingly and the industrialization occurring slowly are among the most
prominent views. Moreover, women's labor force participation being extremely low is another
structural issue. The work force costs being relatively high and the intensive capital structure
being an important source for the economic growth are among the other factors listed as the
explanations about the topic.
The Key Features of Labor Market in Eskişehir: When the demographic features of
Eskişehir are considered, the city's population as a whole is 812.320 by 2014. The population
consists of 49.9% men and 50.1% women. The population of working age (14-64) in Eskişehir is
582.837. This group constitutes 71.7% of the whole population. The population growth rate of
Eskişehir in 2013-2014 is 1.58%. The working age in Eskişehir in proportion to the city's
population is higher than the country-wide working age. Child population rate of the city (0-14)
is lower than the country-wide rate. The old aged population rate (over the age of 65) is higher
than the country-wide rate. The old aged dependency rate being 13.6% is higher than 11.8%
country-wide rate, while young dependency rate being 39.6% is lower than the % 48 country-
wide rate. As for child dependency, it is 25.4% in Eskişehir and 36.9% in Turkey. According to
the results of "The Demand Research in Labor Market in Eskişehir" by June 30, 2014, the three
sectors having a locomotive role in the net unemployment change are manufacturing,
construction and wholesale and retail trade. The net unemployment change rate being 4.8% in
Turkey is 3.4% in Eskişehir by June 30, 2014.
2.4. Location and Infrastructure
Anadolu University constitutes 3 campuses all located in Eskişehir. Yunusemre Campus is
the main campus housing the Rectorate building, the library, the student center, conference
centers, 14 faculties, 7 graduate schools, 1 school, 1 state conservatory, 2 vocational schools and
26 research centers. Iki Eylül, the second campus, houses 3 faculties, 1 graduate school, 1
vocational school, 4 research centers and 1 airport. The third campus, relatively smaller one, is
Porsuk campus housing 2 vocational schools and 1 graduate school. All three campuses are
located in easily accessible locations. Eskişehir is located 330 km from İstanbul, the largest city
in Turkey and 230 km from Ankara, the Capital. There are high speed train services to both of
the cities.
2.5. The Number of the Faculties and Research Centers
Anadolu University has 17 faculties (3 of which have open-education system), a state
conservatory, 2 shools, 4 vocational schools, 9 graduate schools, 30 centers and 21 units. The
organizational chart of the university is presented in Appendix-3.
Anadolu University comprises 2111 academic members including 252 professors, 259
associate professors, 498 assistant professors, 322 academics, 440 research assistants, 231
instructors, 109 specialists, as of December 2014 (Appendix-4).
In total, 2327 administrative personnel work at Anadolu University. 79.5% of them have
government official status, 5.5% are permanent workers, 4.7% are contract employee and
10.3% are temporary staff (Appendix-5.).
2.6. Institutional Autonomy
2.6.1. Institutional Autonomy in terms of Human Resources and Financial Resources
Academic members are employed within the scope of 2547 Higher Education Law, in
accordance with the Law 5434 and 5510. Our university can assign academic personnel by
adding other criteria through publication if the related criteria that are stated in the applicable
legislation are provided. Administrative personnel are employed based on centralized Public
Personnel Selection Exam (KPSS). While assignment is done by the government, the university
can determine the staff's title and position only.
Not having financial autonomy is one of the fundamental financial constraints that
universities have in Turkey. State funds which are provided by Finance Ministry are limited with
small increases on annual basis. Universities cannot use the funds which are created by
themselves without the permission of the Ministry.
2.6.2. The Capacity of Determining Education, Research, and Innovation Profile
The centralized structure of Turkish Higher Education system does not provide the
universities with autonomy up to the mark except academic subjects. Universities can take
relatively full advantage of their autonomy in educational areas. In response to the changing
educational demands and needs, universities can offer new degree and non-degree programs,
open new schools and centers - provided that they get the permission from the CoHE. Partnering
with different industries in joint-research projects, companies started by the academic staff,
collaborating with other universities inside and outside of Turkey are also examples of the use of
their autonomy.
The cooperation strategies with the sector and the development plan of Anadolu
University are composed by taking our country's national and local objectives into account and
by combining them with the fields in which our university is powerful.
Four development axes are specified in the 10th Development Plan of the Ministry of
Development including 2014-2018 period: "Qualified People, Strong Society", "Innovative
Production, Stable Growth", "Liveable Places" and "Sustainable Environment and International
Cooperation for Development".
Furthermore, in the Local Development National Strategy, prepared by the Ministry of
Development (2014-2023 Plan), Eskişehir is ranked among the cities whose focus is industrial
growth. As a result of this, it is expected that University-Sector cooperation opportunities in
Eskişehir and in the region will increase and it will have an important role in the increase of the
number of employment and entrepreneurship thanks to the synergy arisen from coordinated
works of universities and sector with joint projects. The prominent sectors in Eskişehir and in
the region are aeronautic, rail systems, ceramics, white goods, and food sector.
From 1958, when it was founded, to the beginning of the 2000s Anadolu University
contributed to our country as an education university. After this period, there has been a
dramatic increase in the scientific research studies. While there were 14 Project Coordinator
researchers (Scientific Research Projects (BAP) + The Scientific and Technological Research
Council of Turkey (TUBİTAK) in 2001, this number increased up to 125 in 2009. As a
consequence of the search conferences in an attempt to develop the future plans and strategies
of the university in 2010, the university created a new position in the senior management, "Vice
Rector", responsible for the scientific research with the thought that "the research should be one
of the priorities of the universities". In parallel with this perspective, the number of the academic
members at the moment taking part in the scientific research as a project coordinator in
Anadolu University reaches up to 440, which makes % 45 of the total academic members. In this
sense, it is possible to state that Anadolu University has established in-house scientific research
culture, and it has been improving continuously. Furthermore, Anadolu University encourages
the academic members to establish companies in technology development zones and/or to take
charge in the companies. Besides, the fact that Anadolu University climbed up to the 16th place
from the 37th place compared to the previous year in 2013 National Entrepreneurship and
Innovativeness Index, and it had the 13th place in 2014 are a sign of the change of the university
on the path of "Entrepreneurship and Innovativeness." Anadolu University's organized industry-
university collaboration began in 1998 with Ceramics Research Centre (SAM). SAM was
incorporated in 2007 and with its 19 ceramics companies it had the name of SAM Inc., as the
partnership of Anadolu University (with 50-50 sector-university portion rate). SAM Inc. still
continues its activities in Eskişehir Technology Development Region as the university-sector
joint research centre.
Anadolu University established Anadolu University Ar-Ge (Research and Development
R&D) and Innovation Coordination Unit (ARINKOM) on March 13, 2013 as a compatibilizer not
only among the units in the university but also between the university and the industry. The unit
was established to use the sources of the university effectively by making the works of R&D
result-oriented, to make the information provided by the university turn into its maximum value
by bringing the information and the industry together and to create a healthy and a sustainable
university-industry collaboration by enabling human capital and infrastructure of the university
to be used actively by the industry.
On January 1, 2014, ARINKOM got the authority of Technology Transfer Office [TTO]
which has been given to only 20 universities by TUBITAK up to now. ARINKOM-TTO offers
service to the industry and the universities in nearby cities (Eskişehir, Kütahya, Afyon and
Bilecik).
ARINKOM-TTO gives support and service especially in the fields of aviation, defence,
material-ceramics, animation, pharmaceuticals-pharmacy, bio-technology, nano-technology, rail
systems, environment and energy and consumer durables. These fields are updated dynamically
by taking the country's priorities, sector demands and the prominent fields of our university into
consideration. Besides, through ANATEK Technology Transfer Industry and Trade Inc. (ANATEK
Inc.) established in Eskişehir Technology Development Region on 09 May 2013, a university-
industry collaboration canal was added to the system to enable instructors to work on project
basis with industry without establishing a company. Especially Anadolu University
Entrepreneurship and Innovation System (AUGİS) which will be supported by ARINKOM-TTO
structure and in which the pre-incubation (ANAÇ), incubation (Anadolu KOSGEB- Technology
Development Centre) and Anadolu Teknopark are situated altogether is one of the most
professional entrepreneurship and innovation systems among universities in Turkey.
Anadolu Technology Research Park (ATAP) Corporation is the executive company of
Eskişehir Technology Development District (ETGB). ARINKOM and ATAP Inc. collaborate to
enable ARINKOM to get in touch with companies within the scope of ETGB and conduct TTO
activities concerning these. Furthermore, under the coordination of ARINKOM, ARINKOM and
ATAP Inc. work together to enable the ideas at the phase of incorporation benefit from the
privileges of technology development regions and carry on business there.
Anadolu University Project Unit was established in order to generate the project culture
and to increase the number and quality of the projects supported by different sources
(Commission for Scientific Projects (BAP), TUBITAK, European Union, Development Agency
(BEBKA), etc.). The unit has made significant contributions especially to the increase in the
number and quality of the BAP projects and the development of the project culture within the
body of the university so far. While performing all these works and studies, the project unit
gained experience especially on studies that could be conducted in instructors' field of studies
along with the sectors. With these experiences gained, ARINKOM and project unit has made BAP
funded projects turn into projects funded by national and international sources and /or projects
aimed at the needs of the sector. Besides, ARINKOM supports the project unit on the subject of
intellectual and industrial property rights of the results of the BAP projects.
Anadolu University Turkish Patent Institute (TPE) Information and Documentation Unit was
established to raise the awareness of researchers at Anadolu University and in the region on the
issue of intellectual and industrial property rights, with the support of Turkish Patent Institute
and the education materials that the unit prepared.
Anadolu University Entrepreneurship Education and Research Unit (AÜGEB) is a unit which
raises awareness in entrepreneurship and provides educational activities on this subject for
Anadolu University students, instructors and in its region. All the activities that this unit has
conducted and all the relations it has established since it was founded enable the university gain
experience in noticing the deficiencies in education of entrepreneurship and how to correct
these deficiencies.
Besides these units, faculties at the university and research centres and laboratories such
as Anadolu University Advanced Technologies Research and Application Centre and Anadolu
University Plant, Drug and Research Centre are also the units that contribute to TTO experience
of Anadolu University with both in-house and external project-based research and university-
sector collaboration activities.
In the setting ARINKOM provides, the units contribute to the TTO activities in the
university, support students, instructors and the sector to create value by working together in a
synchronized way. At this point, it is important for Anadolu University to have instruments that
enable itself to start university-sector collaboration step by step. In this context, the 'project-
based internship' becomes prominent as one of the important collaboration activities of Anadolu
University with the sector.
Project-Based Internship Programme aims to develop solutions for the anticipated
problems in accordance with the needs of the sector and provide interns whose studentship still
continues with the experience related to business life before graduation. For the projects to be
conducted under this programme in the direction of the needs of the sector, students from all
departments in Anadolu University can be chosen as interns. Instructors as academic advisors
and representatives from the sectors as industrial advisors guide interns during the whole
process. In addition to this, seniors' graduation projects (theses), master theses and doctoral
dissertations are conducted on the subjects that interest industry and in a similar structure
(student-academic and industrial advisor) within the scope of Education-Research Collaboration
Programme.
The coordination of regional partners and their working together towards the same goal is
of utmost importance in order to carry out university-industry collaboration activities and
succeed in these. Anadolu University is in contact with non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
representing the industry in the region by realising this necessity.
Activities which will be conducted on TTO activities have been planned in detail among
ARINKOM TTO, Eskişehir Industry Chamber and ATAP Inc. and Executive Company of Eskişehir
Technology Development Region. According to these protocols, the needs assessment and
evaluation surveys are conducted in companies within the scope of the chamber and in
Technology Development Region respectively through the joint studies conducted by ARINKOM-
TTO with Eskişehir Industry Chamber and ATAP Inc. once in a year separately. After these
evaluations, in order to determine the activity schedule of the next year, parties come together
once in a year and create a joint activity schedule calendar. Furthermore, relations with three
business groupings (Eskişehir, Bilecik, Kütahya Business Grouping Association, Eskişehir
Business Grouping Association, Eskişehir Rail Systems Business Grouping Association)
established in the areas which have priority for both the region and Anadolu University and also
the areas where Anadolu University took active part in the process of establishment, still
continue and a consensus has been reached on the issue of sharing Anadolu University's R&D
project suggestions with these business groups and exchanging information on the evaluation of
projects and implementation on the subjects agreed.
2.6.3. The Capacity of Determining the Administrative Structure
Anadolu University is structured in accordance with the administrative structure
determined for state universities within the scope of Higher Education Law no 2547. Rector is
responsible for the management of the University and chairs the Senate and the Executive
Board. The Senate functions as policy and decision making organ in all academic and
administrative matters. In Anadolu University, the Senate consists of the Rector, 5 vice-rectors,
17 faculty deans, 17 representatives elected by faculty boards of each faculty, 3 school directors,
4 vocational school directors, 9 graduate school directors, the representative of research
assistants and the president of the Student Council. The Senate meets at the beginning and at the
end of each semester or at the call of the Rector when needed.
The University Executive Board is the highest decision making organ in the university
administration. The Board consists of the Rector as the president of the board, 17 faculty deans
and 3 professors elected by the Senate. In Anadolu University, vice rectors, directors of schools,
vocational and graduate schools are also invited to attend the board meetings, but without
voting rights. The University Executive Board generally meets every week throughout the year.
The organization chart of the University is given in Appendix 3. The counterpart of the
Senate in faculties is the Faculty Board, and of the University Executive Board is the Faculty
Executive Board. The Faculty Board consists of the dean as the president of the board, the
department heads and 3 professor representatives, 2 associate professor representatives, 1
assistant professor representative, 1 research assistant representative and 1 student
representative. The Faculty Executive Board consists of the dean, 3 professors, 2 associate
professors and 1 assistant professor elected by the faculty board. Organization chart of the
faculties is given in Appendix 6.
A parallel administrative structure is present in the garduate schools. The School Board
consists of the director of the school, 2 vice-directors and department heads. The Graduate
School Executive Board consists of the director of the school, 2 vice-directors and 3 academic
staff elected by the graduate school board. The research centres have the director, vice-
directors, the Executive Board and the Advisory Board. The University Secretary General is
responsible for all administrative units and there are Faculty Secretary Generals responsible for
their administrative staff.
Majority of the operational activities of the University are automated. The University runs
automated information systems on student affairs, human resources, accrual and accounting,
revolving funds, library and distance education bureau management.
2.7. The National Quality Assurance System
Bologna Process which aims to realize the idea of a comparable, competitive, transparent
European Higher Education District officially started with the declaration of Bologna in 1999.
Turkey participated in this process in 2001.
Anadolu University, chosen as one of the pilot universities for Turkey Higher Education
Proficiencies Framework study which was started for national proficiencies to be developed in
the Bologna process, completed these studies immediately and started to implement the field
proficiencies alligned with the learning outcomes. The Council of Higher Education (CoHE) sent
an appreciation certificate of achievement to Anadolu University for completing the piloting

3.3.1. Institutional Quality Assurance Policies
In the year 2005, all the work and proposals within the Bologna Process initiated to secure
and to improve the quality of higher education and to create a standardized quality culture in
higher education were published in the report entitled as "The Quality Assurance Principles and
Standards in European Higher Education", prepared by European Association for Quality
Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA). In the report, special emphasis was put on the issues
that all higher education institutions should have quality assurance policies; and that they
should gather and analyze the data regarding teaching and research activities and use it within
the aim of strategic management; and that they should publish both the quantitative and
qualitative actual data in an objective and transparent way and then submit it to the surveillance
of both the public and the internal and external stakeholder organizations. In 2005, with the aim
of meeting the requirements of Bologna Process, Anadolu University started to establish its own
quality assurance policies and systems.
In accordance with the Academic Evaluation and Quality Improvement Regulations of The
Higher Education Board passed on 20 September 2005, Interuniverstiy Council founded the
Higher Education Academic Evaluation and Quality Improvment Comission (YÖDEK) on 30
September 2005. Such developments have been a breakthrough accellerating the continouous
improvement efforts of Anadolu University. In 2005 ANADEK was founded. In addition to this,
on 01 January 2005, implementing strategic management policies in public institutions was
made mandatory to increase the efficiency of Public Finance Management and Control Law
based on the strategic planning. Since 2006, in an effort to make use of the resources in an
efficient, ecomonic, and productive way within the frame of financial transparency and
accountability, Anadolu University has been annually publishing adminisrative activity and
financial situation report.
The work Anadolu Universiy has carried out so far within the frame of present Quality
Assurance Policies are listed below:
 A strategic plan was prepared. The application of the basic priorities for achievement
and improvement was evaluated by the help of the Activity Report and Performance
Programme. The actual data was released to the public in a transparent way via the
Internet.
 Competence and course-learning outcomes of all the programmes were portrayed
and published by means of Anadolu Information Package (ABP).
 Some faculties completed their accreditation and evaluation process by the
independent institutions regarding thier education-instruction processes, and
academic research activities were supported by the senior management.
 External evaluation support has been obtained under the scope of the Institutional
Evaluation Programme of European Universities Association (EUA).
 Within the aim of getting Diploma Supplement label, and European Credit Transfer
System (ECTS) label, the requirements were followed and the labels were obtained.
 Internal Control System was established and the process has tried to be made
functional with a great effort.
 The Unit Risk Committees and The Risk Supreme Board were constituted in order to
detect and evaluate the risks and to take actions against these risks.
3.3.2. Institutional Evaluation Regarding the Programme, Department and Research
Since 2000, students' opinions about the instructors have been gathered with "The Course
Evaluation Questionnaire". The results of the questionnaires are available to the instructors in
order to encourage self-improvement. Depending on the questionnaire results, the average
scores for each instructor are collected and taken into consideration in the contract renewal and
rewarding processes to a certain extent. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria of Anadolu
University is also used in the academic promotion of the academicians besides the terms laid
down by the law.
Students' opinions on education, management services, facilities, social and cultural
activies are evaluated with the help of "The Student Opinion Questionnaire". The results are
consulted during necessary amendments.
Within the frame of quality improvement efforts of the accredited or under-accreditation
units, external stakeholders' views are used as feedback during the improvement of outcome-
based education programmes.
Students' academic performances are being monitored by Registrar's Office. Annual data is
gathered regularly ever year and is used to evalute sutudents' performances.
At regular intervals, by organizing meetings with student clubs, students' views are
consulted in the solutions of current problems. Student clubs encourage the students to become
more efficient and sociable.
Psychological Guidance and Counseling Service determines the students' socio-
demographic features, problems and expectations. In the light of the obtained results,
necessary improvements are made by the Rectorship. Besides the workshops concerning
personal and social developments, psychological guidance and counseling services are provided
on individual and group levels by Psychological Guaidance and Counseling Service.
For a more efficent management of research and development activities, one of the vice-
rectors has been assigned for this field. Furthermore, a Research and Development and
Innovation Coordination Centre (ARİNKOM) was established under this vice-rector's
responsibility in order to direct the instructors' research, innovation and etrepreneurship
facilities, to create, prepare and report research projects and to implement them.
Anadolu University monitors the R&D evaluation process through some indicators such as
"projects", "presentation and participation in academic conferences, seminars and symposiums",
"articles published in journals and conference proceedings", "the number of books and post-
graduate thesis". These indicators are used in the promotion process of academic staff and
presented to Council of Higher Education (CoHE) in annual reports.
Instructors are supported in their attendance to national and international conferences.
The Project Unit makes the required arrangements, pursuing the national and international
priorities and the developments in research. Scientific research projects submitted to the
Project Unit are evaluated according to the referee views within the related Project Sub-
Committee of the departments (Social Sciences, Faculty of Science, Health Science, etc.).
Scientific Ethics Committee is formed so as to remind the researchers and students of the
universally-accepted rules regarding scientific ethics.
3.3.3. Institutional Application of European Norms Regarding Institutional Quality
Assurance
3.3.3.1. Quality Assurance Policies and Procedures
The university bases the evaluation of quality applications on SWOT analysis. The scope
and content of SWOT analysis is suitable for the self-evaluation criteria set by the Committee of
Higher Education Academic Evaluation and Quality Improvement and it also corresposnds with
The Quality Assurance Standards and Application Principles for Higher Education Institutions in
the European Higher Education area.
As an expansion of Bologna Process, ECTS creditation system is used in all units of the
university and all the graduate students are provided with "Diploma Supplement". Having been
revised in the 2007-2008 academic year, ECTS Credits were revised once more in the light of the
opinions obtained from the questionnaires on the courses students took in the 2013-2014
academic year.
As requirement of quality process, Anadolu University has been promoting the
accrediation of all units and programmes on both national and international level. In this
context, while the Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Letters, Faculty of
Pharmacy, Faculty of Architecture and Design-Department of Architecture and 28 two-year
degree programmes of Open Education Faculty have completed accreditation process, some
programmes offered by the Open Education Faculty, School of Foreign Languages and Faculty of
Fine Arts are still in the process of accreditation.
3.3.3.2. Revising and Updating Programmes/Levels
The task of the revision of the programme structures and curricula is assigned to the
related units by the university management. On a regular basis, department /unit committees
revise and update their programmes considering the internal and external stakeholders' views.
The process of opening up a new programme starts with the submission of a file, prepared
by a unit and approved by the related committee, to the Rectorate. This file containing
information such as the justification of these new programmes, national and international
examples, courses and course contents, benefits of the programme, infrasturcture of the
department in terms of lecturers, and student approval terms is evaluated by the University
Senate. When the Senate approves the decision, it is then directed to the Higher Education
Senate to be confirmed. It is the Committee of Higher Education that is to reach a definitive
judgement about opening up a new programme.
3.3.3.3. Student Assessment
Student achievement is assessed by various methods such as mid-term examinations, final
examinations, assignments, tasks, projects and hands-on practices. Information about this
process is announced to the students via web-based Anadolu Informantion Package (ABP). The
syllabus is also included in ABP. Further information on Introduction, Content, Learning
Outcomes, Teaching Methods and Strategies, Programme Outcome Support and Testing and
Assessment is included in ABP as well.
3.3.3.4 Academic Staff Competence
The recruitment of new academic staff is carried out based on the "Anadolu University
Academic Staff Recruitment Policy and Evaluation Standars". Further criteria may also be added
by the related unit. On the other hand, the competence of the candidate in lecturing is not
examined before the employement process. In addition, "Course Evaluation Survey" is used in
order to evaluate the lecturers' performance in lecturing. When the result of this survey is equal
to or higher than 3,5 out of 5, %50 more of the lecturing grade is taken into account in academic
promotion.
In the observation of the competence of the academic staff, the following tools are also
employed:
 Accreditaion processes,
 Student feedback (course evaluation surveys, undergragute or graduate student surveys),
 Promotion/ recruition criteria,
 Performance-based rewarding system,

these facilities, students can have access to e-books, e-journals, master's and doctorate thesis
from any point in the campus. The library also provides visually-impaired students with 466
audio textbooks, 47 visual books and a printer and scanner that turns the text into Braille
alphabet. The library also provides tablets to the students and academicians for their use within
the library premises.
Besides the library facilities, wireless internet access is available on campus, which
students can make use of during their education and research. Additionally, in every unit,
students can benefit from computers with internet access in the computer labs.
An academic advisor is assigned to help each student with academic issues when they
register any programme at Anadolu University. Students can get support from Psychological
Guidance and Counseling Services Centre from specialized expert psychologists not only with
their individual developments and problems but also with the social issues through individual or
group meetings without any charge.
Anadolu University students are provided with opportunites to pursue their interests or
broaden their horizons through various cultural, social, scientific and artistic activities in 52
student clubs. Student clubs, social projects, and intership opportunities help the students
enhance their education and equip them with various skills and the advantage of getting into
the bussiness world a few steps ahead their peers when they graduate. With the part-time
student-employment system enabling the students to work in one of the units of the university,
students are given the opportunity of putting their theoretical knowledge into practice, in
addition to getting the chance of having working experience and earning some money. Students
are also given financial support to take part in several activities such as academic confrences,
symposiums, workshops, and panels. Additionally, within the scope of the Cultural Activities
course, students are provided with the opportunity of improving themselves on a broader level
by participating in various academic and cultural activities.
In Anadolu University, Unit for Students with Disabilities supports undergraduate
students with disabilities. In order to make disabled students' life easier and ensure their full
participation into education this unit takes precations and implements necessary adjudgements
by detecting their needs and supplying necessary equipments from the first moment of
registration to Anadolu University. The Unit also offers a wide range of support including
individualized teaching practices, course and exam regulations, and social and pscyhological
help in corporation with the other units.
At the end of each academic year, projects prepared by the students and suported by the
University are presented in project fairs where the owners of the projects meet bussinesmen
and intresting projects are supported by them.
All the services and support offered to students are constantly revised and developed
taking students' opinions into consideration.
In terms of the number of exhange students and full-time international students,
Anadolu University ranks among the top and maintains its preferability high because of the
opportunities offered to students. The number of international students makes it one of the
leading universities in Turkey. In our university, there are 1064 full-time international students
from 108 different countries, and every year nearly 120 Erasmus students get educated.
There is also a Law Clinic where foreigners and exhange students can get first-hand
services in case of any violation of their rights. In this clinic, information about the law system in
Turkey and about their rights and responsibilities are provided to the exchange students and
foreigners with the corporation of Faculty of Law and Internatonal Relations Unit. In addition to
this, at the beginning of the semester, students are also given flyers explaining Turkish Law in 5
different languages including Turkish, English, German, French, and Italian.
Exhange students and candidates are also provided with psychological support in case of
any possible difficulties and psychological problems students might experience by the
Psychological Guaidance and Counseling Service.
As in other universities, accomodation for exhange students is a problem for Anadolu
University, however; some precautions have been taken in order to descrease the adverse
effects of this problem for the students. In this respect, exchange students are given the
opportunity of free accomodation during the first five days of their stay at one of the hostels on
the campus until they find an appropriate place to stay.
Furthermore, with the aim of finding a constructive solution to the accomodation
problem, International Relations Unit matches national and exhange students and encourages
them to live together, thereby contributing to inter-cultural learning and communication
opportunities for both parts.
Throghout the year, various tours are organized to significant places and historical
landmarks of Turkey. Most important of all is the tour to St. Antoine Church which gives the
Christian students the chance to attend the Christmas rite.
During the academic years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the total number of students
coming with Erasmus exhange programme was 295, and 43 for Mevlana exchange programme
which was initiated in the academic year 2013-2014.
While academic recognition is of great importance in terms of increasing the number of
the students going abroad and assuring the quality of the actvities carried out, it is not adaquate
on its own; for this reason, several other studies are carried out continuously.
Regular meetings conducted to inform both the students and the staff about the
exchange programmes help these programmes to be kept on the agenda and help the students
and the staff to get accurate and current information.
Carefully planned orientation programmes help the students to be prepared for the
bureaucratic process, culture shock, and every single stage of the exchange programme.
While 974 students went abroad from Anadolu University with Erasmus Exchange
program during the academic years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the figure for Mevlana exchange
programme was 23 during the same period of time.

number of students/instructors/personnel, domestic and international mobility of
students/instructors, publications, projects, activities conducted, awards, etc.), financial
information (budget mobility, mobile supply transactions, etc.), and administrative activities
into the system. Thus, all the information about the university is collected in the same
environment. This information is evaluated by relevant units and the senior management of the
University. According to the obtained results, the University's administrative, financial and
academic improvement activities are given direction. The actual performance indicators of the
university, educational materials and their costs are determined. The information collected and
evaluated here is used in the preparation of the University's Strategic Plan.
Surveys are made about undergraduate and recently graduate students, the relevant
department's physical structure, its equipment, its access to the library and to the learning
materials, its student-academic/administrative staff relations, along with academic and social
activities about the program, and students' opinions on whether they gain professional
competence in their field. Also, alumni contact information is collected. All this information is
evaluated by the relevant departments and the senior management of the University. The
information is subsequently used to determine students' satisfaction levels and to develop
learning materials of the units.

services are made to our university. Those done to respond to these demands are
summarized below:
i) To meet the demands on education, certificate programs were opened, Open
Education courses were provided for the students having their education in other
universities, and in the last 5 years, 21 associate degree programs and 4 degree
programs have been opened in the Open Education faculties. In addition, 23 e-
certificate programs were opened in the Open Education System. 3 of these are the
Western European e-certificate programs. 254 face-to-face programs were opened
and/or updated. In the last five years, six new education, practice and research
centers have been opened (Appendix 8).
ii) As mentioned in Section 2.6.2 in detail, Anadolu University ARINKOM-TTO serves
both the universities and industries in the region (Eskisehir, Kutahya, Istanbul and
Afyon) in order to coordinate R&D and innovation activities within the university, to
make results-oriented R&D activities so as to use resources efficiently within the
university, and to create the highest level of knowledge conversion value at the
university by bringing knowledge and industry together.
iii) Also, ANATEK Technology Transfer Industry and Commerce Inc. established in
Eskişehir Technology Development Zone was added to the system to ensure project-
based work between instructors and the industry even without setting up a
company.
iv) Anadolu University Project Unit was established in order to create a project culture
within the University and to increase the number and nature of the projects of
Scientific Research Projects (BAP) Commission, supported by the university
resources. So far with their work, this unit has especially contributed significantly to
the increasing number and developing nature of the BAP projects in Anadolu
University. As a result of this work to promote research activities, currently the
number of faculty members carrying out a project has reached 440, which
constitutes 45% of the total number of faculty members in Anadolu University.
When the numbers of the projects conducted and completed between the years
2009-2014 are examined, it is seen that the number of postgraduate thesis projects
is 520, the number of general-purpose projects is 460, the number of infrastructure
projects is 70, and the number of projects promoting publications and research is
335.
v) In terms of serving the society our university, performing an important
breakthrough in recent years, has spread "Community Service Practice" lesson with
the participation of all students. In this context, joint efforts are made with, social
services, NGOs, hospitals, libraries. Our university has provided support in the
"Eskişehir Capital of Cultural Heritage" project scope and has supported a number of
permanent artwork to be created in Eskişehir. In addition, it offers social services
with its different institutions in the context of "Special Education" which is one of
the most powerful areas of our university. Individuals with hearing disabilities from
infancy to adulthood are provided with educational services in the Education,
Practice and Research Center for Children with Hearing Impairment. Individuals
with speech and language disorders from infancy to adulthood are presented
services in Education, Practice and Research Center for Individuals with Speech and
Language Disorders. Service is given for children with developmental disabilities
(autism, intellectual disabilities, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy) and for their
families in Research Institute for Individuals with Disability; for students with
hearing impairment in undergraduate and graduate levels in the Integrated Disabled
School, gifted and for talented children in the recently opened Center for Gifted
Education Research and Application.
b) The rapid increase in the number of universities in recent years and the parallel increase
in the quota and the legislation in some areas can be indicated as among one of the
indicators of outside threats directed to our University. In spite of the related legislation,
in the fields of education, research and community service, resource use on its own
initiative is not possible. Nevertheless, efforts to take action on the threat, the works and
construction activities of our University are ongoing in cooperation with state and
private institutions.
c) Turkey having a young population and growing demand for education is the opportunity
of our University. In this regard, cooperating with other institutions (Universities, Higher
Education and Ministries), our university has entered into a rapid development process
in the face-to-face and open education. For Example; by signing protocols with Konya
Karatay University and İzmir Yaşar University, face-to-face university students of related
universities have been provided with the opportunity to take lessons from Open
Education Faculty of our university. In addition, our all instructors are given the
opportunity to participate in international conference, symposia and seminars at least
once a year; and in national convention, symposia and seminars at least twice a year with
the resources our university has created. This also gives our teaching staff the
opportunity to improve themselves and increase the number of their publications.
Eskişehir, where our university is established, has a superior image all over Turkey. This
makes it demanded by students very much and also leads our student quota to be filled.
3.4.2. Involvement of External Stakeholders in Strategic Management
The University cannot engage in direct cooperation with its external stakeholders
regarding the administrative and strategic issues. The basic reason for this is the university's
being subject to special laws and regulations as a public institution. However, Anadolu
University is committed to cooperate with the relevant institutions while making decisions
associated with its external stakeholders.
3.4.3. Extent of Autonomy
Centralized structure of the Turkish Higher Education System does not provide the
universities with the required level of autonomy except in academic issues.
The university has attempted to take relatively full advantage of its autonomy in
educational areas. In response to changing educational demands and needs, the University can
offer new degree (associate/undergraduate/graduate) and non-degree programs, open new
faculties and centers with the approval of the Senate. Partnering with various sectors in joint-
research projects, establishments founded by academic staff and partnerships with other
universities in national/international contexts can be ranked among the examples of the use of
its autonomy.
3.4.4. Changes to be Made Regarding the Institutional Objectives
The following are among the objectives the University plans to develop or tries to reach
in the next five-year period;
• To institutionalize the culture of competence-based education,
• To improve the units' opportunities related to education,
• To increase the efficiency of information and communication technologies in the
education system,
• To improve living conditions in all campuses of the university,
• To develop and use the infrastructure effectively,
• To give priority to interdisciplinary projects and to projects that serve to community
service

facilities owned by the University and social media,
• To increase cooperation with non-governmental organizations serving community,
• To provide all segments of the community with service-oriented cultural, artistic,
sports and scientific national and international events in a more effective way,
• To ensure the sustainability of student-centered, flexible, accessible, and technology-
based quality of Open Education System,
• To increase the effectiveness of communication and learning technologies in the
Open Education System,
• To provide the training and development of human resources for Open Education
System,

the university,
• To increase national and international recognition.
3.4.5 The Consistency among Mission, Objectives and Activities
Anadolu University is implementing a new Strategic Plan covering years 2014-2018.
Board of Academic Assessment and Quality Improvement is leading the work on the constitution
and the implementation of the Strategic Plan. Compliance between the strategic objectives of the
University and objectives, activities of the units is ensured through sub-committees in the
academic units. Monitoring and improving activities are conducted in a participatory manner.
Annual Unit Activity Reports indicate the path covered in the implementation of the Strategic
Plan.
3.4.6. The Role of Quality Monitoring and Quality Management Processes
In the light of regular feedback from internal and external stakeholders, the university
has continuously been updating and improving future plans and activities.
With regard to Administration, primarily the "Regulation for the Internal Control
Monitoring and Steering Committee Working Principles" was prepared in order to identify risks
that may be encountered during any activity and practices taking place in the University and
determine the necessary precautions to be taken; and then "Risk Supreme Council " and "Unit
Risk Board" were formed for the same aim.
In the educational context, one of the main goals of the university is to increase the
number of accredited programs/units. In this context, accredited units are regularly monitored
and evaluated by the relevant accreditation institutions.
Anadolu University has collaborated with external independent auditors on financial
processes. For Example, our university was audited financially by Ernst & Young auditing
company in 2013.
Faculty of Engineering was awarded the Turkey Excellence Awards for its efforts in
implementing the EFQM Excellence Model and received the EFQM European five-star
certification in 2014.
Anadolu University, besides all of these, has been working to make the Quality Assurance
System steadier by receiving external evaluation from the internationally respected institutions
such as European University Association (EUA).
3.5. Anadolu University and Internationalization
Anadolu University, aiming for being an internationally known universal university, in
accordance with the basic principles, mission and vision it owns has given great importance to
the quality improvement efforts as an essential part of the Bologna Process since its foundation.
Internationalization strategy of Anadolu University is a coherent strategy which has been
discussed institutionally and which is followed by the structured and responsible Committees.
As Anadolu University continues onsite internationalization and cross-border
internationalization activities together, it also considers quantitative factors as well as
qualitative progress in these activities. Concerning onsite internationalization activities,
exchanges, activities such as hiring foreign students and faculty members, research and project
partnerships have been successfully maintained. Anadolu University, which has become a global
brand in the field of open and distance Education, continues the cross-border
internationalization activities through Open Education Faculty. As part of the Bologna reforms,
ECTS Credit System is used throughout the University, and all graduates are given the Diploma
Supplement.
3.5.1. Internationalization and Instructors
Being aware of the fact that internationalization is an overall workspace, Anadolu
University carries out its studies intensively to make all of its components a part of these
awareness-raising activities. The administrative and academic staff is encouraged to increase
their international competence. Staff is supported with in-service training and exchange
programs. In addition, various measures are taken for the effective utilization of exchange
programs budget.
3.5.2. Anadolu University Dual Degree Programs
Various units of Anadolu University continue following dual degree programs in
collaboration with universities in various countries:
• Graduate School of Education Sciences/SUNY Cortland English Language Teaching
M.A. Dual Degree Program,
• Faculty of Education/SUNY Cortland English Language Teaching Dual Degree

• Faculty of Science/University at Albany The agreement process regarding Biology
and Chemistry Dual Degree Program still continues.
3.5.3. Cross-Border Higher Education Activities
Anadolu University, which has become a global brand in the field of Open and Distance
Education, continues cross-border higher education activities through Open Education Faculty.
Foreign students have been registered in the programs opened for districts through the
offices in Europe, Balkans and Azerbaijan; and studies have been conducted to increase the
number of students. In addition, studies are carried out for students enrolled in distance and
open education to take part in international activities. These studies include projects aiming to
make the virtual exchange possible and social projects involving the students. In addition, Open
Education Faculty, which started using ECTS credits in the academic year 2013-2014, has
achieved reaching the international standards with the course loads.
3.5.4. European Volunteer Service (EVS)
Application as "sender", "host" and "coordinating organization" has been made to
European Volunteer Service Accreditation. Accreditation was taken in February 2015 (Appendix
9). In the framework of this program, volunteer/cultural exchanges, which will improve our
students socially, will have been carried out in addition to academic exchange programs carried
out in our university.
Similarly, in order to improve co-operation with civil society organizations in Europe an
application for contact building seminar project involving 8 institutions has been made in the
scope of EVS application.
3.5.5. Courses Based on International Cooperation
In order to help the students who cannot benefit from the international mobility gain
international and intercultural experience, "Courses Based on International Cooperation"
coordination has been established within the International Relations Unit. In this context, the
university has become a member of Global Partner Netwok (GPN), which is formed by 20
American and 17 non-American universities under the leadership of SUNY COIL (Collaborative
Online International Learning) Center. In April 2015, presenting a strategic partnership project
proposal on "Virtual Erasmus" to the European Commission has been planned in order to
increase the efficiency of work in this field.
