STRATEGIC PLAN
2026-2029
A word from the
Vice-Chancellor
and President
For more than a century, Our founders spoke of a "people's university" -
a University for Queensland - created to broaden
The University of Queensland (UQ)
opportunity, advance knowledge and strengthen
has been defined by an enduring communities. That founding mission continues to
guide us today.
and unifying purpose: to deliver for
This Plan builds on the structure of UQ's previous 4-year
the public good.
Strategic Plan while maintaining a longer term focus on
the University's ambitions for 2032. Some initiatives from
the previous plan continue and mature, while others have
evolved in response to new opportunities and the changing
needs of our communities.
A clear example of how rapidly new opportunities are
emerging is the rise of artificial intelligence. AI did not
appear in our last Strategic Plan; yet today, generative AI
is reshaping how we learn, work and interact with
knowledge. Our response to AI is therefore embedded
throughout this Plan.
Our strategic focus
The Plan is structured around 3 domains that articulate
the University's key ambitions: delivering for the public
good; teaching and learning; and research and innovation.
Across these areas, we outline our strategies for preparing
graduates to lead and contribute meaningfully to society,
advancing research that addresses global challenges,
and partnering to deliver tangible social benefit.
The objectives and measures of success within each domain
focus on broadening UQ's contribution - socially, culturally,
environmentally and economically - in Queensland,
across Australia and around the world.
Supporting these domains is an enabling priority centred
on our people and sustainable operations. This reflects our
recognition that UQ's capacity to contribute depends on
the talent of our people, the strength of our culture and
the long-term sustainability of our operations.
Delivering for the public good Teaching and learning

to expand educational opportunities, promote innovation
and respond to regional priorities.
Our commitment to advancing reconciliation remains
steadfast. Under this Plan, we will implement our Stretch
Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) while working towards
a fair, equal and inclusive society in which Indigenous and
non-Indigenous Australians come together to create a
better future.
STRATEGIC PLAN
2026-2029
Research and innovation
We will continue to strive for excellence in discovery science
and fundamental research as a vital source of innovation.
At the same time, we will deepen our leadership in research
translation and commercialisation by partnering with
government, industry and the community to translate
knowledge into societal benefit. Innovation precincts will
remain a priority, enabling interdisciplinary collaboration
to address complex challenges.
UQ's research strength is powered by our community of
HDR candidates, early- and mid-career researchers and
world-leading investigators. We will continue to cultivate
a supportive research culture with systems that enable
growth, reward collaboration and help every researcher
realise their potential.
Looking to the future
We enter into this next 4-year strategic planning period
from a position of strength. We are fortunate to have
exceptional capability across our people, a robust culture,
beautiful campuses, a track record of delivering widespread
community benefit, and the resources to continue investing
in our mission.
The achievements of our diverse community -
staff, students, alumni and partners - demonstrate
the impact a university can have when grounded
in a commitment to serve the public good.
This Strategic Plan sets our course for 2026-2029 -
as we work towards our longer term ambitions. By 2032,
when the eyes of the world are focused on Queensland,
UQ will be recognised for the many ways we deliver for
the public good - preparing students for their future career,
advancing discovery and innovation, enriching lives and
cultures and strengthening the communities we serve.
